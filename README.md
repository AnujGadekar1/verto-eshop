 
# üõí Verto E-Shop ‚Äî Full-Stack Shopping Cart Application

**Verto E-Shop** is a minimal yet production-grade full-stack e-commerce system built using **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend and **React + TypeScript (Vite)** for the frontend.

This project was developed as part of the **Verto ASE Coding Challenge**, focusing on clear separation between backend and frontend, clean API design, and effective client-side state management.

---

##  1. Project Overview

The system demonstrates a complete e-commerce flow:

- Fetching products from a hardcoded catalog (**no database required**)
- Managing cart state on the client side
- Persisting cart items using `localStorage`
- Simulating checkout with an API call to the backend
- Logging the order on the server with total calculation and validation

###  Architecture Overview
- **Backend (Spring Boot)** ‚Äî Handles product listing, checkout validation, and order logging.  
- **Frontend (React)** ‚Äî Manages cart UI, state, and checkout simulation.  
- **Testing (JUnit)** ‚Äî Validates business logic and API endpoints.

---

##  2. Features Implemented

### üíª Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Product grid fetching data from backend `/api/products`
- Add-to-cart functionality with quantity tracking
- Cart overlay with:
  - Real-time quantity updates  
  - Live total calculation  
  - Item removal
- Checkout button that sends data to backend `/api/checkout`
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Cart persistence via `localStorage`
- Fully responsive design (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (Spring Boot)
- `/api/products` ‚Üí Returns hardcoded list of 5 products  
- `/api/checkout` ‚Üí Accepts cart JSON, validates items, logs order, and returns summary  
- CORS configured for `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:5173`  
- Structured logging for orders  
- Unit + integration tests for service and controller layers

###  Bonus Features
- Quantity modification directly in the cart  
- Persistent cart across page reloads  
- Real product images (Unsplash/Walmart CDN)  
- UUID-based order IDs for realism  
- Clean, professional UI with animations

---

###  Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend/verto-shop

# Build and run the Spring Boot server
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
````

Backend runs at:
üëâ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

**Verify:**
Visit [http://localhost:8080/api/products](http://localhost:8080/api/products) ‚Äî you should see a JSON list of products.

---

### üíª Frontend Setup (React + Vite + TypeScript)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at:
üëâ [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

##  4. Running Test Cases

All backend tests use **JUnit 5 + Spring Boot Test**.

```bash
# Inside backend folder
cd backend/verto-shop
mvn test
```

##  5. Design Choices & Assumptions

1. **No Database (per challenge)**
   Products are hardcoded in-memory via `ProductService`.

2. **Separation of Concerns**

   * Backend ‚Üí APIs & validation
   * Frontend ‚Üí State & UI management

3. **Local Cart Management**
   React Context + `localStorage` for persistence.

4. **Image URLs**
   Real images from trusted CDNs (Unsplash, Walmart).

5. **Checkout Simulation**
   Backend logs structured JSON of every order.

6. **Testing Approach**
   Integration and service tests ensure reliable API behavior.

---

##  6. System Architecture Overview

###  High-Level Flow

1. **Frontend (React)** ‚Üí Fetches `/api/products` ‚Üí Displays product grid
2. User adds items ‚Üí Cart updates locally and syncs to `localStorage`
3. Checkout ‚Üí Sends `POST /api/checkout` with cart JSON
4. **Backend (Spring Boot)** ‚Üí Validates, calculates totals, logs order, and returns response

##  8. Deployment & Scaling (Beyond the Challenge)

While this system fully meets all **Verto ASE Challenge** requirements, I also explored how it can be evolved into a **production-ready and scalable application**.

The goal was to design it so that future developers can extend it easily ‚Äî from local testing to global-scale deployment.

---

###  Step 1 ‚Äî Containerization

The first step toward production is **Dockerizing** both the frontend and backend.  
Each service can run in its own lightweight container with all dependencies included.

Using **`docker-compose`**, we can orchestrate the React and Spring Boot containers together ‚Äî ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

**Benefit:**  
>  No more ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù issues ‚Äî everything runs identically everywhere.

---

###  Step 2 ‚Äî Cloud Deployment

Once containerized, deployment becomes seamless.

- The **Spring Boot backend** can be deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **Render**, or **Azure App Service** ‚Äî all of which natively support Java containers.  
- The **React frontend** can be hosted on **Netlify** or **Vercel** for globally distributed static delivery.  
- A custom domain can then route both services for a unified, production-grade experience.

**Example:**
```

api.verto-eshop.com   ‚Üí Backend (Spring Boot)
app.verto-eshop.com   ‚Üí Frontend (React)

```

---

###  Step 3 ‚Äî Database Integration

In production, instead of hardcoded data, we‚Äôd integrate a **persistent database** for product and order management.

**Options include:**
-  **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî for relational data consistency  
-  **MongoDB** ‚Äî for flexible document-based storage  

The backend would adopt **Spring Data JPA/Hibernate** for ORM (Object Relational Mapping), ensuring reliable entity management, order persistence, and seamless schema evolution.

**Benefit:**  
> Orders, users, and product data remain durable, queryable, and auditable long-term.

---

###  Step 4 ‚Äî Scaling the System

To ensure high performance and reliability as traffic grows, we can implement:

**Horizontal Scaling:**  
- Deploy multiple backend instances behind **NGINX** or an **AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

**Caching Layer:**  
- Use **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (like product catalogs), drastically reducing response times.

**Static Delivery Optimization:**  
- Serve frontend assets and images through a **CDN** (Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront) for ultra-fast, global content delivery.

**Authentication & Security:**  
- Implement **JWT-based authentication** for secure user sessions and role-based access control.

**Continuous Integration & Delivery:**  
- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions** to automate build, test, and deployment for both frontend and backend.

**Result:**  
>  Faster release cycles, minimal downtime, and smooth, automated updates.
